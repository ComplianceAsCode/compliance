          You can control which users and teams can create and manipulate Docker
          Datacenter resources. By default, no one can make changes to the
          cluster. Permissions can be granted and managed to enforce
          fine-grained access control. Authentication and authorization
          documentation for the management of users and teams can be found at
          https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.0/guides/user-management/ and
          at https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.1/guides/user-management/.
          The various levels of permissions provided by Docker Datacenter can be
          found at
