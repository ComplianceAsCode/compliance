Permissions can be granted and managed to enforce fine-grained access control. Authentication and authorization documentation for the management of users and teams can be found at https://docs.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry/user-management/.

    narrative: "Both Docker Trusted Registry and Universal Control Plane share the same authentication service. This service does not have the ability to automatically remove or disable accounts after a set period of time. However, using Docker Datacenter's centralized LDAP integration capabilities, one can disable user objects in a connected directory service (such as Active Directory). Documentation for configuring LDAP integration can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/configuration/ldap-integration/."

    narrative: "Docker Datacenter logs various authentication and authorization events to standard log files. In addition, Docker Trusted Registry can be monitored by following the documentation at https://docs.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry/monitor-troubleshoot/. Automatic notification of specific account management events is not a capability of Docker Datacenter. However, one can configure Universal Control Plane to direct these event logs to a remote logging service such as an Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack and subsequently alert on specific event types. Instructions for configuring this for Universal Control Plane can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/configuration/configure-logs/. Since Docker Trusted Registry user account management shares the same backend service as Universal Control Plane, the previously linked documentation also applies."
