    'Docker Enterprise Edition is an integrated solution for developers and IT
    operations to collaborate as part of the enterprise software supply chain.
    It is an enterprise-grade secure container orchestration and application
    management platform built and maintained by Docker, Inc. Docker Enterprise
    Edition (Advanced) is made up of five core components: Docker Enterprise
    Edition Engine, Docker Trusted Registry (DTR), Universal Control Plane
    (UCP), integrated authentication and authorization service (eNZi) and Docker
    Security Scanning (DSS).
    
    For each control origination, the cloud service provider (CSP) is in context
    to you, the Docker Enteprise Edition consumer. The customer in this context
    is any entity outside your organization using your services. Definitions for
    each of the control originations referenced by the components are as
    follows:

    - Service Provider Corporate: A control that orignizations from the service
    provider corporate network
    - Service Provider System Specific: A control specific to a particular
    system at the service provider and the control is not part of the standard
    corporate controls
    - Service Provider Hybrid: A control that makes use of both corporate
    controls and additional controls specific to a particular system at the
    service provider
    - Configured by Customer: A control where the customer needs to apply a
    configuration in order to meet the control requirement
    - Provided by Customer: A contriol where the customer needs to provide
    additional hardware or software in order to meet the control requirement
    - Shared: A control that is managed and implemented partially by the
    service provider and partially by the customer'
