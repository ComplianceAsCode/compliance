        text: "You can control which users and teams can create and manipulate resources in Universal Control Plane. By default, no one can make changes to the cluster. Permissions can be granted and managed to enforce fine-grained access control. Authentication and authorization documentation for the management of users and teams can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/user-management/authentication-and-authorization/. The various levels of permissions provided by Universal Control Plane can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/user-management/permission-levels/."

    narrative: "Universal Control Plane is made up of multiple backend services that provide for centralized identity. Descriptions of each of those services can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/architecture/. Documentation for managing users and teams in Universal Control Plane can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/user-management/create-and-manage-users/ and https://docs.docker.com/ucp/user-management/create-and-manage-teams/."

    narrative: "Universal Control Plane does not have the ability to automatically remove or disable accounts after a set period of time. However, using Universal Control Planeâ€™s LDAP integration capabilities, one can disable user objects in a connected directory service (such as Active Directory). Documentation for configuring LDAP integration in Universal Control Plane can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/configuration/ldap-integration/. This also applies to Docker Trusted Registry since it uses the same backend authentication service as Universal Control Plane"
