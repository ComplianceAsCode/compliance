          You can control which users and teams can create and manipulate
          resources in Universal Control Plane. By default, no one can make
          changes to the cluster. Permissions can be granted and managed to
          enforce fine-grained access control. Authentication and authorization
          documentation for the management of users and teams can be found at

          Docker Datacenter logs various authentication and authorization events
          to standard log files. In addition, a Universal Control Plane cluster
          can be monitored by following the documentation at
          https://docs.docker.com/ucp/monitor/monitor-ucp/. Automatic
          notification of specific account management events is not a capability
          of Docker Datacenter. However, one can configure Universal Control
          Plane to direct these event logs to a remote logging service such as
          an Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack and subsequently
          alert on specific event types. Instructions for configuring this for

          By default, Universal Control Plane is configured to use the
          underlying logging capabilities of CS Docker Engine. As such, on the
          underlying Linux operating system, only root and sudo users and users
          that have been added to the 'docker' group have the ability to access
          the logs generated by UCP backend service containers. In addition,
          only UCP Administrator users can change the logging endpoint of the
          system should it be decided that logs be sent to a remote logging
          stack. In this case, the organization is responsible for configuring
          the remote logging stack per the provisions of this control.

          Docker Content Trust is a capability provided by CS Docker Engine that
          enforces client-side signing and verification of Docker image tags. It
          provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and
          received from Docker Trusted Registry and the public Docker Store.
          These signatures allow client-side verification of the integrity and
          publisher of specific image tags. All Universal Control Plane Docker
          images are officially signed and verified by Docker, Inc.

          When installing Universal Control Plane, you should enable Docker
          Content Trust (per the instructions at
          https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/) and
          subsequently pull the the signed UCP image tag.

          Universal Control Plane can be configured to identify and authenticate
          users via it's integrated support for LDAP. Users and groups managed
          within the organization's LDAP directory service (e.g. Active
          Directory) can be synchronized to UCP on a regular interval. When a
          user is removed from the LDAP-backed directory, that user becomes
          inactive within UCP. In addition, UCP teams can be mapped to groups
          synchronized via LDAP. When a user is added/removed to/from the LDAP
          group, that same user is automatically added/removed to/from the UCP
          team. Instructions for configuring LDAP integration can be found at
