        text: "You can control which users and teams can create and manipulate resources in Universal Control Plane. By default, no one can make changes to the cluster. Permissions can be granted and managed to enforce fine-grained access control. Authentication and authorization documentation for the management of users and teams can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/user-management/authentication-and-authorization/. The various levels of permissions provided by Universal Control Plane can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/user-management/permission-levels/."

    narrative: "Both Universal Control Plane and Docker Trusted Registry share the same authentication service. This service does not have the ability to automatically remove or disable accounts after a set period of time. However, using Docker Datacenterâ€™s LDAP integration capabilities, one can disable user objects in a connected directory service (such as Active Directory). Documentation for configuring LDAP integration can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/configuration/ldap-integration/."

    narrative: "Docker Datacenter logs various authentication and authorization events to standard log files. In addition, a Universal Control Plane cluster can be monitored by following the documentation at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/monitor/monitor-ucp/. Automatic notification of specific account management events is not a capability of Docker Datacenter. However, one can configure Universal Control Plane to direct these event logs to a remote logging service such as an Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack and subsequently alert on specific event types. Instructions for configuring this for Universal Control Plane can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ucp/configuration/configure-logs/."
