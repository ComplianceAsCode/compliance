By licensing this project under the CC0 Public Domain, we've made it easy to make contributions.

## Reporting issues

Much of this content is based on the existing documentation provided at https://docs.docker.com/. Bear in mind that this repository is not meant to house issues specific to the Docker docs site. Please refer to the public source repo at https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io for any issues related to those docs.

Instead, this project should be used to report issues specific to wording in the narratives, typos, bugs in the nlp tool, and/or content/feature requests.

## Submitting pull requests

To keep things simple, we're encouraging folks to adopt the forking workflow. Pull requests should be submitted on a separate branch from your own fork of the repository. Any updates and commentary should be clear and concise. If you're looking to make changes to the `component.yaml` files, please try to limit each narrative's text block line length to 80 characters. There are various tools and editor extensions that can help automate this.
