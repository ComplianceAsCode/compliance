      - text: "Built-in firewall technology in CS Docker Engine's underlying operating system can be used to force the disconnection of remote connections to the host. In addition, CS Docker Engine provides the option to pause or drain a node in the cluster, which subsequently stops and/or removes sessions to the node. Individual services and/or applications running on CS Docker Engine can also be stopped and/or removed."
